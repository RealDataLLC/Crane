The original Shahzad et al. data was many times lower compared to the average and all other data points for incandescent , CFL and LED lamps. It's assumed that there is some inconsistency with the conversion from fossil C to carbon footprint: Shahzad et al. used a ratio of 3.667/500 but it potentially should have been only 3.667. As a result, the Shahzad data is multiplied with 500 resulting to CO2 amount of manufacturing in the same ballpark as other sources (except for CFL, which is on the high side with this conversion).
